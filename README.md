# cachemgmt
This application will be a cache management console and can be connected across different caches such as Memcached/Coherence/etc.Most of the times during our application development we will be accessing through cache provided console where we will apply queries to browse the cache store and view the data present in it .sometimes this gets difficult if team members involved are new and it really slows down the development .

We thought it is good to have GUI based console and it can be even be shared with business users as most of them they will not be aware/access the cache store where data are temporarily managed
